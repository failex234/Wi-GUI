# Wi-GUI
A very simple Wi-Fi GUI for Linux that uses wpa_supplicant, wpa_passphrase and dhcpcd to
easily connect to predefined or to a custom network.

# Installation
If you want to install this script just copy it to /usr/bin.
I will provide a Makefile in the future!

# Before you use the Script
You need to change the 2 predefined network names right at the beginning of the script
to suit your needs. You can also add some more but then you need to expand the script
a bit more!

# Dependencies
- Bash
- wpa_supplicant
- Sudo
- dhcpcd
