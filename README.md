# Wi-GUI
A very simple Wi-Fi GUI for Linux that uses wpa_supplicant, wpa_passphrase and dhcpcd to
easily connect to predefined or to a custom network.

# Before you use the Script
You first need to change the network interface to your desired interface.
You can also edit network1 and network2 so that you don't have to type
in the network name everytime you want to use this script.

# Installation
If you want to install this script just copy it to /usr/bin or you can
just run it rightaway.
I will provide a Makefile in the future!

# Dependencies
- Bash
- wpa_supplicant
- Sudo
- dhcpcd

# Disclaimer
This is my first bash script so nothing beautiful! But it works at least
